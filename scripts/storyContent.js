            "Perhaps also unsurprising are retail investors' choices: the companies and funds offering the greatest returns. This chart shows retail investors' top ten stock picks in the early months of 2023. All are universal household names such as Tesla, Amazon, Apple, and Google (or ETFs containing a collection of these names); these are names with which novice investors are already familiar. Within the opening months of 2023, retail investors had already poured over $23 billion into these equities. Hovering a wedge in the chart provides a <span style=\"font-weight:bold; color:#fa0; text-shadow:1px 1px 2px #eee;\">tooltip</span> summary of that equity's representation.",

            "The late 1990s saw the previous largest market entry of retail investors during a period now called the \"dot-com bubble\". A wide swath of technology stocks experienced extreme speculative overvaluation spurred by the introduction and explosive growth of the Internet just a few years prior.",
            "Novice investors flocked to stocks which seemed to be increasing in with no end in sight. Many naively overinvested in overvalued stocks, and when the bubble burst in late 2000, a panicked sell-off ensued, lasting two years. This brought the value of the S&P 500 index, typically seen as the general U.S. market indicator, to nearly half of its 2000 peak as seen in the chart. Many investors, and indeed retail investors, experienced financial hardships as a result.",

            "The dot-com burst, though significant, was not the end of the market. And although some stocks failed, the market moved on and returned to an overall steady, upward trajectory over the next five years.",
            "As can be seen, to panic and exit the market during the downturn is a poor decision for two main primary reasons. First, any stocks that an investor purchased during the bubble period would have been sold at a loss. Second, investors would miss out on a growing market, and would have to buy back into the market at a higher price, also having foregone potential recovered losses from stocks sold during the downturn.",
            "In the expanded S&P 500 chart, we now see a fuller perspective of the market over a longer period of time. Even though the market took a big hit, it was able to recover overall. The recovery took a number of years, however, and demonstrates the necessity in adopting a long-term growth strategy for a stronger portfolio rather than buying into greed and fear with a short-term perspective.",
            "Unfortunately, many of the novice dot-com retail investors were swept up in the short-term perspective and, ignoring the long-term perspective, panic sold their positions for heavy losses."

            "These record levels were short-lived, however. In December 2009, the financial sector experienced a complete meltdown. A housing bubble burst combined with years of banks' subprime mortgage lending practices resulted in many borrowers defaulting on their loans in a short period. With consumers running out of cash to spend, and banks with limited cash to lend, all sectors of the market followed in the collapse like a house of cards. The crisis quickly spread worldwide.",
            "The S&P chart shows the speed and impact of the event. In less than a year and a half, the index's value plunged 60%, experiencing multiple periods of near free-fall. By late February 2009, the value of the S&P 500 was around 680, or 15% further below its dot-com burst low. This downturn turned into a recession, and was termed \"The Great Recession\" - a nod to its similarities to the Great Depression of the late 1920s and 1930s.",
            "Again staring in the face of another financial crisis, investors were faced with the same test. Should they exit the market to preserve what remains of their net worth? Or should they stay invested in one of the worst markets downturns in a century and hope for another recovery as had consistently occurred before?"

The market  growth of the past 14 years completely dwarfs the market of the 2000s which appeared much more dramatic when viewed in isolation. Clearly, a long-term perspective is key to market success.",

The market has recently been battle-tested in just about every way: from political upheaval to a once-in-a-centry global pandemic. After each of them, however, the world, and the market, continued to move forward.",
