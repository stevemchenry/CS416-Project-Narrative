            "In recent years, the U.S. equity market has seen a slew of new retail (personal, non-professional) investors enter the market in numbers not seen in over two decades.",
            "After having witnessed many sectors of the market generate explosive returns, and having received thousands of dollars in \"free\" money from multiple stimulus packages, it's not difficult to see the market's attraction to new investors.",
            "Perhaps also unsurprising are retail investors' choices: the companies and funds offering the greatest returns. This chart shows retail investors' top ten stock picks in the early months of 2023. All are universal household names such as Tesla, Amazon, Apple, and Google (or ETFs containing a collection of these names); these are names with which novice investors are already familiar. Within the opening months of 2023, retail investors had already poured over $23 billion into these equities. Hovering a wedge in the chart provides a <span style=\"font-weight:bold; color:#fa0; text-shadow:1px 1px 2px #eee;\">tooltip</span> summary of that equity's representation.",
            "With these new investors having experienced only a period of strong growth and healthy returns begs the question: <span style=\"font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;\">are these new investors prepared to weather the next inevitable market downturn?</span>"

            "The late 1990s saw the previous largest market entry of retail investors during a period now called the \"dot-com bubble\". A wide swath of technology stocks experienced extreme speculative overvaluation spurred by the explosive introduction and growth of the Internet just a few years prior.",
            "Investors flocked to stocks which seemed to be increasing in value for months to years with no end in sight. Many naively overinvested in overvalued stocks, and when the bubble burst in late 2000, a panicked sell-off ensued, lasting two years and bringing the value of the S&P 500 index to nearly half of its 2000 peak. Many investors, and indeed retail investors, experienced financial hardships as a result as a result of their overcommittment into their stock bets.",
            "Today's market climate seems to have echoes of the dot-com bubble, where retail investors are flocking to primarily technology stocks whose values are currently soaring. As we'll see next, investors should be careful to simply cut all of their losses and completely exit the market in the event of a downturn, however."
